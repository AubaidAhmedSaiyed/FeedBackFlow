Slow App - Crashes Frequesntly
The app is very slow to load and often crashes during checkout.
Payment gateway did not respond, and I had to try twice.
The user interface is confusing and not mobile-friendly.
Login sometimes fails without showing any error.
Great idea, but the overall experience is frustrating due to performance issues.
