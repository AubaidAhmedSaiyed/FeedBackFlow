it is a lightweight C++ command-line tool that simplifies the process of collecting, managing, and analyzing customer feedback.
It provides two key modes:

User Mode:

  📍Submit feedback easily through a simple interface.
  📍View all previously submitted feedback entries.

Product Manager Mode:

  📍Analyze feedback to detect major pain points (e.g., slow performance, crashes, payment issues).
  📍detect overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) from user feedback.
  📍Identify high-priority feedback based on urgency keywords.
  📍Prioritize features based on impact versus effort scoring.
  📍Make decisions based on customer satisfaction ratings.


The project uses structured classes - file handling - basic string manipulation - menu-driven interaction to create a complete mini product management workflow.
